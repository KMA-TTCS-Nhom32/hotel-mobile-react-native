## Features Implemented

### 1. Booking Creation Flow
```typescript
User clicks "Confirm Booking"
  â†“
handleBooking() creates CreateBookingOnlineDto
  â†“
createBooking mutation called
  â†“
API: POST /booking with booking data
  â†“
Response: Booking object with code
```

### 2. Payment Method Routing
```typescript
ON SUCCESS (booking created):
  IF payment_method === 'CASH':
    â†’ Navigate to /payment/success
    â†’ Show "Pay at hotel" message
  
  ELSE IF payment_method === 'VIET_QR' or 'MOMO':
    â†’ Call createPaymentLink()
    â†’ Get payment link data (qrCode, account details)
    â†’ Navigate to /payment/qr-confirmation
  
  ELSE:
    â†’ Navigate to /payment/success (fallback)
```

### 3. User Data Integration
- Booking uses user data from `authStore`:
  - buyerName: user.name
  - buyerEmail: user.email
  - buyerPhone: user.phone
- No need for manual guest details entry

### 4. Error Handling
- **Booking Creation Fails**:
  - Shows Alert with error message
  - "OK" button to dismiss
  - User can retry

- **Payment Link Creation Fails**:
  - Shows Alert with error message
  - "Use Cash" button â†’ Switches to CASH payment method
  - "Retry" button â†’ Tries payment link creation again

### 5. Loading States
- **isCreatingBooking**: Shows "Creating booking..." in button
- **isCreatingPaymentLink**: Shows "Processing payment..." in button
- **isProcessing**: Disables button and shows loading spinner

## API Integration

### Booking Service
```typescript
// src/services/booking/index.ts
export function createBookingService(data: CreateBookingOnlineDto) {
  return privateRequest.post<Booking>(ENDPOINTS.BOOKING, data);
}
```

### Payment Service
```typescript
// src/services/payment/paymentService.ts
class PaymentService {
  async createPayment(data: CreatePaymentRequestDto): Promise<any> {
    const response = await privateRequest.post(
      ENDPOINTS.CREATE_PAYMENT,
      data
    );
    return response.data;
  }
}
```
